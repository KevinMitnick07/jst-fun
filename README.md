Project Description
‚Äújst kidding‚Äù ‚Äî Mallu Memes!
A playful, single-page React app that brings iconic Malayalam movie comedy to life through cartoon-style actor faces, funny dialogues, wacky sound effects, and a comic-strip vibe. Tap, laugh, and relive legendary lines ‚Äî no logins, just pure front-end fun!

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
üòÖ The Problem (That Doesn‚Äôt Exist)
No one asked for a cartoon grid of legendary Mallu actors delivering their funniest movie lines...
But now that you‚Äôre here, don‚Äôt you kinda want it?

We‚Äôre drowning in serious apps, productivity tools, and ‚Äúlife-changing‚Äù platforms.
Where‚Äôs the pure nonsense? The joy? The bounce?
Where‚Äôs the love for those iconic Malayalam one-liners that live rent-free in your head?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
MADE WEB
